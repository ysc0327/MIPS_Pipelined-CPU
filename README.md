# MIPS_Pipelined-CPU
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This is NCKU Computer Architecture and IC design LAB course project. 

The project is Single cycle CPU.

I have written a insertion sort assembly code, and test in my Single cycle CPU.
I have modified some part of testbench, because "memory needs 8 bits width in each address".

Implenment 23 instrucetion, contain :

Rtype :
  nop  add  sub  and  or  xor  nor  slt  sll  srl  jr  jalr
 
Itype :

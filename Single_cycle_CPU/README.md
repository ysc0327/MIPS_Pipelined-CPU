# MIPS_Single cycle CPU

This is NCKU Computer Architecture and IC design LAB course part of project. 

The project is Single cycle CPU.

I have modified some part of testbench, because "memory needs 8 bits width in each address", and used a insertion sort assembly code to test my Single cycle CPU function.


Total implenment 23 instruction, contain :

Rtype :
  nop  add  sub  and  or  xor  nor  slt  sll  srl  jr  jalr
 
Itype :
  addi  andi  slti  beq  bne  lw  lh  sw  sh
  
Jtype :
  j  jal
